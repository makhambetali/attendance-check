This project was created to facilitate the process of checking who came to school and who did not. 
The database is limited to only one class, since the project was created not for the purpose of popularization, but only to facilitate the work of the curator and the headman. 
The bottom line is that each student marks himself and the one he has already seen at school. 
The results will be visible on the site itself, and if you need to save it in writing, just click the "Reports" button and the data will be saved in writing in the clipboard.

Every day at 9 p.m., the data is reset to zero, and students can mark themselves in advance.

Due to the fact that the project does not require special data security and has limited functionality, it was decided to use the Flask framework.

To execute the program, just run main.py
